# Where My Node Actually Lives
# ============================================================

# I'm running Ganache locally on my machine
PROVIDER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545

# Been thinking about trying testnet later...
# PROVIDER_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY

# Or maybe Alchemy? Heard good things about their API
# PROVIDER_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY

# QuickNode is another option I bookmarked
# PROVIDER_URL=https://your-endpoint.quiknode.pro

# ============================================================
# My Account Stuff
# ============================================================

# This is my main account for deploying contracts
# Format's pretty straightforward: 0x + 40 hex characters
# Got this from Ganache when I started it up
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1

# My private key - super important to keep this safe!
# No 0x prefix, just the 64 hex characters
# Honestly, I was paranoid putting this in here even as example
# Got it from the same place as my address
PRIVATE_KEY=4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113d26dada3cff76ec46d3d3679

# Backup Provider Options I'm Keeping Around
# ============================================================

# Been meaning to sign up for Alchemy
# They have a free tier which is nice for learning
ALCHEMY_KEY=

# Infura is pretty popular, might switch to them
# Just need to grab my project ID from their dashboard

# QuickNode's on my radar too
# Their endpoints look clean and they have good docs

# Started with 1 (normal), but might need to bump this up
# Learned about this the hard way when transactions kept timing out
GAS_MULTIPLIER=1

# Pretty standard for local testing
# Read somewhere that 3000000 is for complex contracts

# Just a simple greeting message for now
# Planning to experiment with different strings

# Faucets When I Run Out of Test ETH

# Ganache Accounts I'm Working With

# When I fired up Ganache, it gave me these accounts

# ============================================================
# Lessons I've Learned So Far
# ============================================================

# SECURITY STUFF
#    - Almost committed .env once. Now I'm obsessed with .gitignore
#    - Private keys are like passwords on steroids - guard them carefully
#    - Testnet and local only during development
#    - Keeping a separate account for when I move to production
#
# GETTING STARTED
#    - First thing: cp .env.example .env (then fill it out)
#    - For Ganache: the example values work out of the box
#    - For testnet: gotta get those API keys from providers
#
# DEPLOYING CONTRACTS
#    - Double-check PROVIDER_URL connects before pushing code
#    - Make sure my account actually has ETH
#    - PRIVATE_KEY shouldn't have 0x at the beginning (learned this painfully)
#    - CHAIN_ID has to match where I'm deploying
#
# WHEN THINGS BREAK
#    - DEBUG=true is my first instinct now
#    - Can test provider connectivity with: curl your PROVIDER_URL
#    - Checking account balance: web3.eth.get_balance(address)
#
# GAS PRICES - They Vary Wildly
#    - Sepolia usually hovers around 20-50 Gwei
#    - Mainnet swings all over the place depending on network congestion
#    - Always estimate before pushing anything on mainnet
#
# FREE TEST ETH
#    - Faucets are a lifesaver, but they have rate limits
#    - I keep screenshots of confirmations just in case
#    - Some days faucets are slower than others
